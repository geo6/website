For several years now, we have been offering a series of tools enabling the environmental administration to manage their equipment (benches, playgrounds, lighting, fountains, waste baskets, ...) in the parks of the Brussels Region.

This suite of tools is composed of modules allowing to manage the inventory of the equipments in real time (descriptive sheet, photo and geographical position), to visualize them in maps, tables and graphs, to attach technical documents, to report a problem, and to follow the maintenance interventions.

This suite of tools is designed to be used both in the office and in the field (on a tablet or smartphone).  
Some functionalities are indeed more used in the field (taking pictures, tracking GPS position, ...) and others in the office (measurement tools, data export, monitoring of inventory evolution and reports, ...).

These tools are generic enough to be adapted to any type equipment in the public space .
