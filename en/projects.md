**Why create or migrate to a dedicated and lightweight geographic database ?**

For GEO-6, a database must be adapted to the needs of an organization and independent of any commercial license. It is no longer a question of limiting your activity or your use of data by a license whose cost is negotiated each year. In addition to the existing open-source geographic data (UrbIS, CRAB, OSM), GEO-6 has created its own address positioning system (geocoding). GEO-6 ensures a certain freedom and accessibility to your organization by implementing a set of projects and open-source web applications that efficiently meet the needs of your organization.

*Example:* A few years ago, a department whose license costs prevented the development of common application with its partners mandated GEO-6 to find a solution.  This department and its partners had each their own paid maps. GEO-6 has thus proposed its services for open-source data usage and processing, allowing its partners to unify their data to avoid paying multiple times a common license. After an in-depth study of existing alternatives, GEO-6 notices that the regions putted their data at disposal of everyone (UrbIS, CRAB), as did OpenStreetMap. Thanks to the open-source, GEO-6 has created a dedicated database at lower cost, corresponding to the needs of the department but as well to its partners.

*Example:* A few years ago, a public transport company decided to change its database providers. Having called GEO-6, thus this one had to recalculate about then thousands of bus route with its own mapping system. This new navigable database now enables the public transport company to effectively manage transport, driver service turnover, timetables, bus stops, etc. Thanks to the dedicated tools created by GEO-6, this company have found a simple solution to a complex situation.

**Why introduce the geography into your organization ?**

Customers or providers, products or services, you should know that 80% of the data of an organization are geographical. Yes, the geography is part of your daily life! But how to transform this geographic information into information useful to your company? For GEO-6, a geographic database is also a geo-marketing tool. Indeed, it allows the production and analysis of statistics in order to have a better knowledge of the coverage of your organization in the field and always meet the needs of your customers.

*Example:* GEO-6 have among its customers an environment administration with a number of parks in Brussels. Who says public parks, so says public lighting. One of the projects was to create a web application for managing all lights with their circuits and power cabinets. A simple and operational system of input of reports and measurements in the field which offered to this company a better system of management and monitoring of its network.

**Why produce thousands of custom maps ?**

Today, it is more efficient to opt for a targeted and personalized communication instead of a global message. It is therefore important for your organization to reach your customers with a direct and personalized message with practical and geographic information adapted to each customer.

*Example:* Different commercial companies used  GEO-6 within the framework of the relocation of a significant number of their customers. The objective of the project is to inform customers of the location of the nearest and easily accessible shop in their new neighborhood according to their needs. GEO-6 then receives a list of new customer addresses, and thanks to the regional databases and an in-house geocoding tool (Batch Geocoder), it positions these new addresses in relation to the company's shops.  
By using extremely powerful servers in view to the complexity of the production of thousands of unique maps (Dedicated Maps), GEO-6 generate an image with address of the customer, the address of the shop chosen and the entire panel of geographic information to get to the shop. A fast and dedicated solution that allows your organization to send your customers a mail with a personalized as soon as they arrive in their new neighborhood.

**Why deploy networks of services that take into account the needs of the citizen and the socio-economic and environmental impact ?**

By deploying a network of services, an organization must consider the utility of these services and their real impact. It is about measuring the profitability and the sustainability of your organization's missions. A complex market study in which geographical analysis takes place.

*Example:* For a mail delivery company, GEO-6 has had as project the study of transit points in order to optimize the distribution of mail. The first question that arises is that of what is the starting and ending point, but quickly comes the problem of the last mile which have a significant cost surplus. At the same time, GEO-6, with the help of an in-house software dedicated to this project, also calculated the coverage areas of the mail boxes, depots and post offices, taking into account the socio-economic data, while aiming at an economic optimization of their number and by analyzing the best locations for them.

**Why adopt protocols for the exchange of data and open-source information in crisis management ?**

In the case of a crisis, one of the important aspects is the transfer of information. But how to structure a message sent in the context of a crisis? It is important for the organization that each of its departments and partners receive clear, compliant, and accessible information. The solution? GEO-6 has developed an automated data capture process coupled with specific tools and a simple and operational cartographic interface to assist with crisis management.

*Example:* In the context of nuclear exercise, at the request of an agency, GEO-6 has thus created a process that allows to format by a predefined charter and facilitates the reading of the messages sent in the context of a crisis from a machine to another. This system makes it possible to immediately inform the various services of the agency of a possible abnormality on the field (Field Data), at the national and international level. Indeed, the charter includes a significant number of standards in term of languages, units, terminologyâ€¦ GEO-6 has therefore developed an application (encoding form) but also a library allowing their application to read and write messages at International Radiological Information Exchange (IRIX) format developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the drafting of crisis messages for field staff as well as crisis managers at the administrative level.
